# TODO: Fix Runtime Error in Homepage.jsx

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Edit Homepage.jsx**: Add null checks for `containerRef.current` and `sunRef.current` in the `animate` function to prevent the "Cannot read properties of null" error.

2. **Test the Fix**: Run the React application and check the browser console to ensure the error is resolved and animations work correctly.

3. **Verify Animations**: Ensure that the tech stack animations and other effects in the homepage function as expected without throwing errors.
